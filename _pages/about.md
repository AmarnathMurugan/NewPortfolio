Hi there! I'm a first-year MS Computing student specializing in Graphics & Visualization at the University of Utah. My research interest is on real-time rendering and animation of digital humans. Currently, I'm working as a Graduate Research Assistant under [Prof P. (Saday) Sadayappan](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~saday/), and our work is focused on accelerating large tensor operations through distributed computing and parallel execution on the GPU.

Previously, I conducted research on storytelling, education, and novel interaction techniques in AR/VR at the [IMXD Lab](https://imxd.in), IIT Bombay, under [Prof Jayesh Pillai](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/pillai-jayesh). I also worked as the Technical Director of [Manhole Collective](https://manholecollective.com/), the creators of the real-time animated short film [Manhole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYyHxQjr3Z8), which won third place in [Unreal's Short film challenge](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/watch-the-top-projects-from-the-shorts-india-program) in India and was screened at the prestigious Annecy film festival.
